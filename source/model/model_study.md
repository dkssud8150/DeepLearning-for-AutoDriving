# milstone of Segmentation

<img src="/assets/segmentation_milestone.png">

i try to study panoptic segmentation, so i use one of model for yellow block. i think that the model included DeepLab is default because DeepLab is very with age. FPN is also very old concept.

this image is research from 2014 to 2020. just what i found in paperswithcode, Mask DINO or EfficientPS, OneFormer is most accuracy model in each dataset. so i use the EfficientPS. and i wanna to develop the Mask DINO or OneFormer after the first deadline.

&nbsp;

if efficientNet and PS is hard to develop or have to spend too much time, it would be good to do the basic model, the U-Net, first.
if i will also develop tomorrow, i try developing U-Net + resNet.
